Section 3. UI Automation:
For this section I include a screencast of how is working the automation test,
I notify that the positions are changing so could be the multiple test will be broken when check the test.
For the multiple test are you asking me for test all the mixes between department and office but the total is 136 cases,
its a lot of cases, even in the real world is a bad practice test to much cases for 2 selects, I made some cases cause i think
that the idea is know how i can resolve a repetitive task
